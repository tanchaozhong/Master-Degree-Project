Environment: This is a R script created on R studio.

R codes for all the statistical test and graphic in my master dissertation <Water level fluctuations influence diversity patterns in Poyang Lake and Rivers> (in Chinese with English abstract)

First, This is not for completely beginner, know the basic function would help a lot in reading those R scripts.

Second, Check the usage of the function by ?function().  It is very helpful. Pay a lot attention to the 'Warnings', that will help you to correct codes

Third, some of the rules have to be followed in order to use those R scripts. Some places have to write on your own based on your own situations, such as places marked "XX", and "..." in the script.

The flow chart below would help you find out: (1) what did I do (e.g., CCA analysis), results I get (e.g., Fig. 3-4), R function I use (e.g., cca() etc.) against my dissertation.
